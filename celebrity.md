# Celebrity

Celebrity is a guessing game that's great for breaking the ice.

Stats:
- Players: 4+, the more the merrier
- Equipment: paper, writing utensil(s), a timer
- Roles: scribe, player, ref, guessers
- Time: 30 minutes to 2 hours, depending on the number of names in the hat

The Rules:
- Distribute paper and writing utensils to everyone.
- Ask everyone to write a name on each piece of paper, of a real or fictional
  character that most people in the room recognize.  Each person can provide
  more than one name.  Duplicate names are allowed.
- Collect the names in a bowl or a hat, and mix them up.  This is the draw
  pile.
- Split the group into two teams.
- Choose a scribe to tally points.  They still get a turn, if they want.
- Choose which team goes first.  Rock, Paper, Scissors is popular.
- For each turn, alternate between teams, and cycle through the people on each
  team.
- No one gets a second turn until everyone has gone once.
- Choose the first player, and a referee from the opposing team.
- The player blindly selects each name from the draw pile, one at a time.
- Only the player and the opposing team are allowed to see the name in play.
- The player has 1 minute to communicate as many names as they can.
- The player may not say, spell, or mouth any words on the paper.
- If the player fouls, the ref makes a sound and the player abandons the name,
  without getting a point for that name.
- Everyone on the team is allowed to guess as many times as they want.
- The team gets 1 point for a correct guess.
- Used names go in a separate pile, until the next round.
- There are 3 rounds: unlimited words, one word, and no words.
- In the 1st round, the player can use as many legal words as they want.
- In the 2nd round, the player can use exactly one legal word to describe the
  name.  Once you have spoken that one word, you may not speak a different word
  until the next name.  Choose wisely.
- In the 3rd round, the player cannot speak.  They must act out the name, like
  charades.
- Each round lasts as long as there are still unused names.
- After each round, put the used names back in the draw pile.
- After round 3, the scribe announces the score.
